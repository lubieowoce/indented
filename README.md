# `indented`
A library for generating Python code (and other indented text).

Made for cases where the `ast` module is too fine-grained
and gluing lines with newlines and tabs becomes too tedious.

Currently, the documentation resides in the docstrings of `indented.text` and `indented.codegen`.
Check them out on [github](https://github.com/lubieowoce/indented).
